\section{Introduction}
Drinking water in cities has now become something that you need to buy in the same way as you buy your groceries. But the biggest difference is that for groceries you have a lot of options to buy from. There are big marts like
\textit{Big bazaar and D-Marts}, 
then you have your local shopkeepers as well. An interesting thing to note here is that now a lot of online platforms are available for delivering your groceries or fruits at your door steps. Some of the big giants like
\textit{Flipkart and Amazon} 
have also started delivering groceries. But none of the companies are there for providing fresh drinking water. So in this paper we will be trying to solve this problem and come out with a practical and modern solution because in future we will be having a lot of problems regarding the drinking water if we are not prepared for it right now.

\section{Case Study: Indore}
In urban cities like Indore, there are widely three types of drinking water supply system working majorly.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Through pipelines
    \item Through Nagar Palika tankers
    \item By local vendors
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[short]{Let us take the example of Indore city and discuss further}
In indore city the municipal charges \textbf{Rs. 50.68} per 1000 litres. which for a month becomes on an average of rs. 152 for regular usage but in case of extra usage 
that actually happens during summer seasons the cost may go high as \textit{rs. 200} per month. on the other hand the water that comes through the pipelines as well as 
the municipal tankers are not actually fit for drinking. recent tests in the water supply of the city has proved that the water that is provided from \textit{Narmada} is 
fine for drinking but the ones provided from the boring is not advised to use directly for drinking purpose. Rather use of R.O is mendatory for that. the other key thing 
to note here is that the water from \textit{Narmada} is not in wide use. the use is very limited and currently government is working for making it available for the rest
of the city as well.
