\section{Introduction}
Drinking water in cities has now become something that you need to buy in the same way as you buy your groceries. But the biggest difference is that for groceries you have a lot of options to buy from. There are big marts like
\textit{Big bazaar and D-Marts}, 
then you have your local shopkeepers as well. An interesting thing to note here is that now a lot of online platforms are available for delivering your groceries or fruits at your door steps. Some of the big giants like
\textit{Flipkart and Amazon} 
have also started delivering groceries. But none of the companies are there for providing fresh drinking water. So in this paper we will be trying to solve this problem and come out with a practical and modern solution because in future we will be having a lot of problems regarding the drinking water if we are not prepared for it right now.
