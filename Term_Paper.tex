\section{Introduction}
Drinking water in cities has now become something that you need to buy in the same way as you buy your groceries. But the biggest difference is that for groceries you have a lot of options to buy from. There are big marts like
\textit{Big bazaar and D-Marts}, 
then you have your local shopkeepers as well. An interesting thing to note here is that now a lot of online platforms are available for delivering your groceries or fruits at your door steps. Some of the big giants like
\textit{Flipkart and Amazon} 
have also started delivering groceries. But none of the companies are there for providing fresh drinking water. So in this paper we will be trying to solve this problem and come out with a practical and modern solution because in future we will be having a lot of problems regarding the drinking water if we are not prepared for it right now.

\section{Case Study: Indore}
In urban cities like Indore, there are widely three types of drinking water supply system working majorly.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Through pipelines
    \item Through Nagar Palika tankers
    \item By local vendors
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[short]{Let us take the example of Indore city and discuss further}
In indore city the municipal charges \textbf{Rs. 50.68} per 1000 litres. which for a month becomes on an average of rs. 152 for regular usage but in case of extra usage 
that actually happens during summer seasons the cost may go high as \textit{rs. 200} per month. on the other hand the water that comes through the pipelines as well as 
the municipal tankers are not actually fit for drinking. recent tests in the water supply of the city has proved that the water that is provided from \textit{Narmada} is 
fine for drinking but the ones provided from the boring is not advised to use directly for drinking purpose. Rather use of R.O is mendatory for that. the other key thing 
to note here is that the water from \textit{Narmada} is not in wide use. the use is very limited and currently government is working for making it available for the rest
of the city as well. But it will take a little more time than expected. 

\subsection[short]{Temporary Solution}
A lot of local water suppliers have now started throughout the city to provide the drinking water to the households. These water suppliers provide water in water cans 
of different volumes like 3L can, 2L can etc. But the problem with this system is its very discontinous or we can say that the distribution of these local vendors are
unevenly distributed that makes it difficult for people living in other areas of the city. How this system works is another point of pain for the people. The local vendors
don't follow a systematic plan. what they basically do is they give their contact number to the people who will buy the subscription and then the people will call them and
ask for the volume of water they require. now the thing is it becomes really difficult to arrange the phone numbers of these vendors. 
\subparagraph*{So on summarising the overall problems}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Its very difficult for the person who is new in the city to find water suppliers.
    \item People have to search for the phone numbers of these suppliers as they dont have their website or app.
    \item For people, there are very few options as they dont know about other water suppliers since there is no information available regarding this.
\end{enumerate}
